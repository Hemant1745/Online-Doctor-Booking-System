## Online-Doctor-Booking-System - Ayuracharya
Ayuracharya is a simple web project that is made for e-channeling through PHP, HTML, and also CSS. This initiative helps clients or patients of medical establishments such as clinics and hospitals when they request appointments online. This project can also be used for helping doctors to manage the appointments that are scheduled with patients. Each patient's appointment schedules will get organized using this doctor's appointment system. These requests then will be submitted by you to the doctor that was selected. The administrator, the doctor, and also the patient are all of the three key roles that are in the system. The system admin will populate the list with doctors, their specialties, doctor's details, and system credentials. Patients can use the doctor's appointment system website to locate a specialist. Patients can review the doctor's weekly schedule for them to select a suitable day and time for their appointment. Their appointment request can be submitted thereafter. After that point, the doctors are able to view all of their appointments. They can view patient appointment requests for checking availability.
